# Lensaissance

A specialized OCR (Optical Character Recognition) application developed as part of the RenAIssance project for digitizing historical Spanish documents. Originally created during Google Summer of Code 2024-2025 by Yukinori Yamamoto (Waseda University, Japan), Lensaissance addresses the unique challenges of processing Renaissance-era documents that conventional OCR tools struggle with due to their distinctive spelling, print styles, and deterioration.

Building upon a custom AI model trained with Self Supervised Learning that achieves 95% accuracy on historical document characters, this application provides an intuitive interface for humanities researchers to digitize documents without requiring technical expertise. The tool features interactive text selection, advanced preprocessing capabilities, and AI-powered text correction through OpenAI's GPT models.

## Project Background

### RenAIssance Initiative
The RenAIssance project is dedicated to developing specialized OCR tools for historical Spanish documents, specifically targeting the needs of humanities researchers who may not have extensive computer engineering backgrounds. Renaissance-era Spanish documents present unique digitization challenges due to:

- **Historical Spelling Variations**: Significant differences from modern Spanish orthography
- **Distinctive Print Styles**: Typography and formatting conventions of the era
- **Document Deterioration**: Age-related damage affecting text clarity
- **Unique Characteristics**: Features that cause conventional OCR tools to fail

### Development History
This application represents the evolution of work begun during Google Summer of Code, where the core AI model was developed with Self Supervised Learning techniques achieving 95% accuracy on historical document character recognition. The current version addresses practical implementation challenges, focusing on preprocessing and user accessibility to bridge the gap between advanced AI capabilities and real-world research needs.

### Design Philosophy
Rather than attempting end-to-end document recognition, Lensaissance adopts a focused approach: enabling users to select specific regions for digitization. This interactive methodology allows researchers to maintain control over the digitization process while leveraging powerful AI models for accurate text extraction.
